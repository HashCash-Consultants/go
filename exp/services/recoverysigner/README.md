# Recovery Signer

This is an incomplete and work-in-progress implementation of the [SEP-30]
Recovery Signer protocol v0.7.0.

A Recovery Signer is a server that can help a user regain control of a Hcnet
account if they have lost their secret key. A user registers their account with
a Recovery Signer by adding it as a signer, and informs the Recovery Signer
that any user proving access to a phone number or email address can have
transactions signed. A user who has registered their account with two or more
Recovery Signers can recover the account with their help.

This implementation uses Firebase to authenticate a user with an email address
or phone number. To configure a Firebase project for use with recoverysigner
see [README-Firebase.md](README-Firebase.md).

This implementation is not polished and is still experimental.
Running this implementation in production is not recommended.

## Usage

```
$ recoverysigner --help
SEP-30 Recovery Signer server

Usage:
  recoverysigner [command] [flags]
  recoverysigner [command]

Available Commands:
  db          Run database operations
  serve       Run the SEP-30 Recovery Signer server

Use "recoverysigner [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Usage: serve

```
$ recoverysigner serve --help
Run the SEP-30 Recovery Signer server

Usage:
  recoverysigner serve [flags]

Flags:
      --admin-port int                   Port to listen and serve admin functionality including metrics (ADMIN_PORT)
      --allowed-source-accounts string   Hcnet account(s) allowed as source accounts in transactions signed for all users in addition to the registered account comma separated (important: these accounts must never be registered accounts and must never have the signer configured that is a signing key used by this server) (ALLOWED_SOURCE_ACCOUNTS)
      --db-max-open-conns int            Database max open connections (DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS) (default 20)
      --db-url string                    Database URL (DB_URL) (default "postgres://localhost:5432/?sslmode=disable")
      --firebase-project-id string       Firebase project ID to use for validating Firebase JWTs (FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID)
      --metrics-namespace string         Namespace to use for metric names prefixed to metrics reported (METRICS_NAMESPACE) (default "recoverysigner")
      --network-passphrase string        Network passphrase of the Hcnet network transactions should be signed for (NETWORK_PASSPHRASE) (default "Test SDF Network ; September 2015")
      --port int                         Port to listen and serve on (PORT) (default 8000)
      --sep10-jwks string                JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) containing one or more keys used to validate SEP-10 JWTs (if the key is an asymmetric key that has separate public and private key, the JWK need only contain the public key) (if multiple keys are provided they will all attempt verification the key ID will be ignored although logged) (SEP10_JWKS)
      --sep10-jwt-issuer string          JWT issuer to verify is in the SEP-10 JWT iss field (not checked if empty) (SEP10_JWT_ISSUER)
      --signing-key string               Hcnet signing key(s) used for signing transactions comma separated (first key is preferred signer) (will be deprecated with per-account keys in the future) (SIGNING_KEY)
```

## Usage: db

```
$ recoverysigner db --help
Run database operations

Usage:
  recoverysigner db [flags]
  recoverysigner db [command]

Available Commands:
  migrate     Run migrations on the database

Flags:
      --db-url string   Database URL (DB_URL) (default "postgres://localhost:5432/?sslmode=disable")
