# webauth

This is a [SEP-10] Web Authentication implementation based on SEP-10 v3.2.1
that requires a user to prove they possess a signing key(s) that meets the high
threshold for an account, i.e. they have the ability to perform any high
threshold operation on the given account. If an account does not exist it may
be optionally verified using the account's master key.

SEP-10 defines an endpoint for authenticating a user in possession of a Hcnet
account using their Hcnet account as credentials. This implementation is a
standalone microservice that implements the minimum requirements as defined by
the SEP-10 protocol and will be adapted as the protocol evolves.

This implementation is not polished and is still experimental.
Running this implementation in production is not recommended.
